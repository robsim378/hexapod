Characteristics:

Performance
	This software will be running on a microcontroller and on a battery. The better the performance, the cheaper the processor will have to be and the longer the battery life.
Robustness
	Unexpected situations will occur. The robot will be moved by external forces and must be able to recover.
Maintainability
	I intend to be working on this project for a long time and making various improvements and upgrades.



Components:

Leg hardware controller
	- Handles interfacing with the hardware in the legs (servos, possibly position sensors to detect errors)
	- Each leg should have its own instance

Leg movement controller
	- Handles plotting a course for a leg, then sends instructions to the hardware controller to execute that course
	- Each leg should have its own instance

Main movement controller
	- Takes an input (direction and speed)
	- Determines what legs should move and where they should move to, then passes that information onto the leg movement controllers for those legs
	- Must know the positions of all legs at all times
	- There should be one instance of this

Input controller
	- Takes input from an input device (e.g. a gamepad) and passes it along to the main movement controller.
	- There should be one instance of this



Architecture style

Pipeline
	+ Movement commands take a straightforward route through the components
	+ Should be easy to work with in the future when expanding the robot's capabilities

Microkernel
	+ Will be very easy to expand capabilities in the future to include features such as LIDAR and autonomous navigation
	- Performance may not be ideal
