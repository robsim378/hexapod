- Plot steps as a starting point and an ending point
	- I believe a straight line between these is all that is needed
	- Should be able to plot a step from any leg position

- Purely forward/lateral movement involves moving all feet in the same direction and the same distance per step
- Purely rotational movement involves maintaining the distance of all legs from the body and rotating the feet around the centre of the body
- Simultaneous forward/lateral and rotational movement will involve a combination of the two.
	- My prediction is that the endpoint of the step can be calculated by applying the function for calculating rotational movement onto the endpoint of calculating lateral movement
		- i.e. first calculate step endpoint for forward/lateral movement, then do it again for rotational from the previous endpoint. That is the endpoint of the overall step.

- Changing input direction, magnitude, or type should give an immediate effect
	- Robot will most likely feel very sluggish if it waits until the end of its current step to change
- Small changes in magnitude will be easy, just slow down the legs.
	- Bigger changes will be trickier since the gait will have to change too.
		- Maybe run the leg that has already started the step a bit slower than the legs being added with the new gait so that they land at the same time
		- For slowing down, just slow down the legs during the current step but finish the step
		- Positions of legs on ground will vary during different gaits, so the first couple steps after changing require special attention
	- If magnitude changes to 0 there may be some extra work needed to make it feel right
		- Need to be careful since this can occur in the middle of reversing a direction, so don't just stop immediately.
- Changes in direction of input or type (i.e. adding rotational movement in the middle of a forward step) will be difficult
	- Will probably require recalculating the endpoint
		- Maybe begin from the current position of the foot
