INVERSE KINEMATICS
- Move foot from point A to point B
- Trace straight line with foot 
- Trace a curve with the foot


ROBOT MOVEMENT
- Forward/backward movement
	- No lateral or rotational movement of body
- Lateral movement
	- No forward or rotational movement of body
- Rotational movement
	- No forward or lateral movement of body
- Forward + lateral movement
	- No rotational movement of body
	- Should move at same speed as either forward or lateral individually
	- Direction vector should be sum of the input vectors
- Forward + rotational movement
	- No lateral movement of body
	- Should move at the same speed as forward input
	- Should rotate at the same speed as rotational input
- Lateral + rotational movement
	- Same requirements as forward + rotational movement, I will be shocked if that passes and this fails or vice-versa
- Forward + lateral + rotational movement
	- Should move at the same speed as either forward or lateral individually
	- Direction vector should be the sum of the input vectors
	- Should rotate at the same speed as rotational input
- Higher input magnitude should result in faster movement
	- Probably linear, but will need to experiment to see what feels right. A curve may allow for more precise movement at low speeds.
- Should respond immediately to changing input direction and/or type
	- Should not wait for step to complete

GAIT
- Wave gait should always have at least 5 legs on the ground
- Ripple gait should always have at least 4 legs on the ground
- Tripod gait should always have at least 3 legs on the ground
- Should switch between gaits depending on speed
	- High speed: Tripod gait
	- Medium speed: Ripple gait
	- Low speed: Wave gait
	- Exact thresholds will have to be determined experimentally
- Should be able to switch gaits in the middle of a step
- Body should remain upright throughout steps
	- Allow higher tolerances for this for faster gaits
	- Exact tolerances will have to be determined experimentally
